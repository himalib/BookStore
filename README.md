# BookStore
Sample BookStore application 
 
Sample BookStore project was continued in the "Employee" project using Dapper. So there are two folders for respective project. The email and password for login are "admin@admin.com" and "Admin1" respectively.
Cookie based authentication was done at first and the projects were continued for the same so Login part is in "AuthnAuthnz" database and for BookStore "BookStore" was created, both of which backups are uploaded in this repository.
The View is in subfolder named "BookStore" under main folder "View". The controller is "BookStore" and "AutherAPIConroller" was also created for fetching author details.
Thankyou!
